# Kalix CLI for GitHub Actions

This [JavaScript action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action) for GitHub workflows installs and configures the [Kalix CLI](https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/index.html) tool. After running this action, the `kalix` command is available in the workflow. 

## Usage

The action takes two required parameters to authenticate and set the Kalix project ID:

* `token`: The Kalix authentication token
* `project-id`: The Kalix project ID you're using

## Example Workflow

The below flow shows how to use this action to list all services in your project

```yaml
name: kalix

on: 
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Kalix CLI
        uses: lightbend/setup-kalix-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.KALIX_TOKEN }}
          project-id: ${{ vars.KALIX_PROJECT_ID }}
      - name: List services
        run: kalix service list
```
